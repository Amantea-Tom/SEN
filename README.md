# Satellite Systems Diagnostics Lab

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and learning space for simulating real-world diagnostic cases in satellite systems engineering.

Each subfolder represents a self-contained case study, typically centered around anomalies in satellite telemetry, attitude control, RF communication, power systems, or operational behavior. The goal is to approach these problems as a Field Application Engineer (FAE) would: diagnosing, analyzing, and proposing system-level hypotheses based on data.

## Scope

This repository will cover areas such as:

- 🛰️ **Antenna & RF performance issues**
- 📡 **Pointing misalignments**
- 🔋 **Power or eclipse-related anomalies**
- 🧭 **Attitude drift or control issues**
- 🧠 **Mode transitions and system degradations**
- ⚙️ **Tools & scripts for telemetry visualization**

Each project folder includes:

- Context and assumptions
- Realistic datasets or generated logs
- Diagnostic methodology and visualizations
- Hypothesis and technical summaries

## Methodology

Each project typically follows this diagnostic sequence:

1. **Data Familiarization**
2. **Visual Exploration of Key Metrics**
3. **Event Correlation** (e.g., signal loss with pointing error)
4. **Cause Hypothesis**
5. **Reporting & Recommendation**

The idea is to simulate not only analysis, but also the reporting, structure and tools used in real operations engineering teams.
