# SEN

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and learning space for simulating real-world diagnostic cases in satellite systems engineering.

Each subfolder represents a self-contained case study, typically centered around anomalies in satellite telemetry, attitude control, RF communication, power systems, or operational behavior. The goal is diagnose, analyse, and proposing system-level hypotheses based on data.

---

## Scope

This repository will cover areas such as:

-  **Antenna & RF performance issues**
-  **Pointing misalignments**
-  **Power or eclipse-related anomalies**
-  **Attitude drift or control issues**
-  **Mode transitions and system degradations**
-  **Tools & scripts for telemetry visualization**

Each project folder includes:

- Context and assumptions
- Realistic datasets or generated logs
- Diagnostic methodology and visualizations
- Hypothesis and technical summaries

---

## Methodology

Each project typically follows this diagnostic sequence:

1. **Data Familiarization**
2. **Visual Exploration of Key Metrics**
3. **Event Correlation**
4. **Cause Hypothesis**
5. **Reporting & Recommendation**

The idea is to simulate not only analysis, but also the reporting, structure and tools used in real operations engineering teams.
